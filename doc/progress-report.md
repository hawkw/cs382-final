# Progress Report

For our final project, we are experimenting with OpenGL shaders and writing some demos. We have chosen to use `glium`, a safe OpenGL library for the Rust programming language.

### Tools

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a safe, functional language intended for systems programming. It is intended to play a similar role to C++, but incorporating ideas from functional programming languages such as Haskell and ML. A major feature of Rust is its compile-time memory management, permitting memory safety to be guaranteed at the language level without the use of garbage collection. [`glium`](https://github.com/tomaka/glium) is a Rust library that provides high-level bindings into OpenGL.
